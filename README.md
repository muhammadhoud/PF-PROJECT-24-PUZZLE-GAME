Welcome to the **24 Puzzle Game** GitHub repository! This project showcases a classic puzzle game implemented in C++, providing an engaging and challenging experience for players.

## Overview
The 24 Puzzle Game, invented and popularized by Noyes Palmer Chapman in the 1870s, is a brain-teasing challenge played on a 5-by-5 grid. The grid contains 24 square blocks labeled 1 through 15, along with a blank square. The objective? Rearrange the tiles so that they are in a specific order, known as the goal state.
